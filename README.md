# Image-segmentation-using-mask-RCNN
This is my major project in b. tech in which we used Mask RCNN for image segmentation
The project is executed in google colab and the environment runtime is set to gpu in the colab notebook
For the working of this project we must download the following repository and then uploaded in the google drive
