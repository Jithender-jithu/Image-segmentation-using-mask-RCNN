This is my major project in b. tech in which we used Mask RCNN for image segmentation
The project is executed in google colab and the environment runtime is set to gpu in the colab notebook
The following packages are imported in the code
%tensorflow_version 1.x

some people may face errors in importing coco files to rectify the error we first need to install h5py version 2.10.0 other versions does not work.
Use the below code

import h5py
